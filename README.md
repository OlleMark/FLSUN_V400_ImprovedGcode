# FLSUN V400 Improved Gcode

Improved klipper gcode for the Flsun V400 3d printer.

The goal of these improved gcode macros is to make the printer get closer to the bambulabs printers whom is the king of "just works" in the current consumer 3d printing space.

This project is not associated with flsun in any way.

To install any of these macros they should be added to your printer.cfg or macros.cfg file depending on wich one you are using. the START_PRINT and END_PRINT macros need to be called from your slicer. The commands to use these macros from cura can be found in the "V400_CuraGcode.cfg" file

If you find anything you want to be improved create a issue or pull request and i will look at it. :)
